		<h3>Your only Competition is you, and you only</h3>
		<p>I think you have already what it takes to have a growth mistake since you already understand that you don’t have to compete with no one.</p>

		<p>So, because you only compete with yourself, you can make your own race, rules, etc.</p>

		<p>First, you can choose what area you want to be better at and set goals. It may be your grades, fitness journey, even writing your blog.</p>

		<p>Start making rules and stick by it. Like you must write 1 blog post per day, work out for 15 minutes, etc.</p>
